# Dynamic Agent

Dynamic Agent is an intelligent, adaptive system designed to process tasks using two primary tools: Respond and Code Execute. It leverages a sophisticated knowledge system and decision-making workflow to accomplish a wide range of tasks.

## Features

- **Dual-Tool System**: Utilizes 'Respond' for information retrieval and 'Code Execute' for task execution.
- **Knowledge-Driven Decision Making**: Uses a robust knowledge graph to inform tool selection and task execution.
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves its knowledge and capabilities over time through task results.
- **Adaptive Code Execution**: Generates and executes Python or JavaScript code to perform complex tasks.
- **Virtual Environment Management**: Creates isolated environments for safe code execution.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and logs the performance of various operations.

## Components

1. **ChatGPT**: Handles natural language processing and generation.
2. **CodeExecutionManager**: Manages the execution of generated code.
3. **KnowledgeGraph**: Stores and retrieves relevant knowledge for tasks.
4. **VirtualEnvironment**: Creates isolated environments for code execution.
5. **ContinuousLearner**: Improves the system's knowledge over time.
6. **LoggingManager**: Handles logging of system operations.
7. **PerformanceMonitor**: Tracks the performance of various system components.

## Workflow

1. The user inputs a task.
2. The system analyzes the task and relevant knowledge to decide whether to use 'Respond' or 'Code Execute'.
3. If 'Respond' is chosen, the user provides information or asks for clarification.
4. If 'Code Execute' is chosen, the system generates and executes code to accomplish the task.
5. The system learns from the task result and updates its knowledge graph.
6. Steps 3-5 repeat until the task is fully accomplished.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Knowledge Retrieval**: Implement more sophisticated algorithms for retrieving relevant knowledge, potentially using embeddings or semantic search to improve the accuracy of the 'respond' action.

2. **Contextual Task Understanding**: Develop a system that can better understand the context of user tasks, including previous interactions and user preferences, to improve decision-making between 'respond' and 'code_execute' actions.

3. **Multi-Step Task Planning**: Implement a planning system that can break down complex tasks into a series of 'respond' and 'code_execute' actions, allowing the agent to handle more sophisticated user requests.

4. **Improved Error Handling and Recovery**: Enhance the system's ability to analyze errors during code execution, suggest fixes, and automatically retry failed operations, reducing the need for user intervention.

5. **Dynamic Code Optimization**: Develop techniques to optimize generated code based on past executions and performance metrics, improving the efficiency of the 'code_execute' action over time.

6. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Create methods to synthesize new knowledge from existing information and execution results, enhancing the agent's ability to respond to novel situations.

7. **Interactive Clarification**: Implement a system for the agent to ask clarifying questions when task requirements are ambiguous, improving the accuracy of both 'respond' and 'code_execute' actions.

8. **Automated Knowledge Graph Maintenance**: Develop algorithms to periodically prune, consolidate, and optimize the knowledge graph structure for improved performance and relevance.

9. **Task Dependency Management**: Implement a system to manage dependencies between tasks and subtasks, allowing the agent to handle more complex, multi-stage operations efficiently.

10. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Develop a mechanism to adjust the agent's learning rate based on the novelty and complexity of tasks, optimizing the balance between stability and adaptability.

11. **Enhanced Security Measures**: Implement robust security protocols for code execution, ensuring that the 'code_execute' action cannot be exploited or cause unintended system changes.

12. **Natural Language Code Generation**: Improve the agent's ability to generate code from natural language descriptions, enhancing the 'code_execute' action's versatility.

13. **Performance Analytics**: Develop a comprehensive analytics system to track the agent's performance over time, providing insights for future improvements and optimizations.

14. **Cross-Domain Knowledge Application**: Enhance the agent's ability to apply knowledge from one domain to solve problems in another, increasing its problem-solving capabilities.

15. **User Feedback Integration**: Create a system to incorporate user feedback on the agent's responses and code executions, allowing for continuous improvement based on user satisfaction.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (list them in a `requirements.txt` file).
3. Set up a Neo4j database and configure the connection details in a `.env` file:

NEO4J_URI=<your-neo4j-uri>
NEO4J_USER=<your-neo4j-username>
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<your-neo4j-password>
VIRTUAL_ENV_BASE_PATH=./virtual_env

4. Run the main script:

python main.py

## Usage

Once the Dynamic Agent is running, you can interact with it by entering tasks. The agent will automatically determine whether to provide a response or execute code based on the task.

Example tasks:
- "What is the capital of France?" (Response)
- "Calculate the factorial of 5" (Code Execution)
- "Create a list of prime numbers up to 100" (Code Execution)

To exit the program, simply type 'exit'.
