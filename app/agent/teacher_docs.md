## Teacher Module

The `Teacher` module is responsible for generating tasks and answering questions to grow the knowledge system through autonomous task generation and completion.

### Key Features

- **Task Generation**: Identifies knowledge gaps and creates tasks to fill these gaps.
- **Question Answering**: Interprets questions, retrieves relevant information, and formulates comprehensive answers.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the agent's performance on generated tasks and adjusts task difficulty and complexity.
- **Knowledge Expansion**: Autonomously expands its own knowledge by generating self-study tasks and integrating new information from external sources.

### Integration

The `Teacher` module integrates seamlessly with the `DynamicAgent` and existing knowledge systems, ensuring a cohesive and efficient knowledge management solution.

- **DynamicAgent**: Interacts with the `Teacher` module to process tasks and answer questions.
- **Knowledge Systems**: Utilizes existing knowledge systems (Episodic, MetaCognitive, Procedural, Conceptual, Contextual, Semantic, Spatial, Temporal) for task generation and question answering.

This integrated approach allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and utilization of various types of knowledge, enabling the AGI to learn, reason, and make informed decisions across a wide range of tasks and contexts.
