# Knowledge Systems Documentation

This document provides an overview of the various knowledge systems implemented in our AGI architecture.

## EmbeddingManager

The `EmbeddingManager` class is responsible for managing text embeddings, including encoding, caching, similarity search, and dimensionality reduction.

Key features:
- Encodes text into embeddings using a pre-trained model
- Caches embeddings for efficient retrieval
- Performs similarity search using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance
- Supports FAISS index for fast similarity search
- Provides dimensionality reduction using PCA or t-SNE

## KnowledgeGraph

The `KnowledgeGraph` class represents the central knowledge storage system, using a Neo4j graph database.

Key features:
- Stores nodes and relationships in a graph structure
- Supports adding, updating, and retrieving nodes and relationships
- Integrates with the EmbeddingManager for semantic search
- Stores various types of knowledge, including task results, performance metrics, and tool usage

## EpisodicKnowledgeSystem

The `EpisodicKnowledgeSystem` manages episodic memory, storing and retrieving task-related experiences.

Key features:
- Logs tasks and their results
- Analyzes tasks and provides insights
- Memorizes episodes (thoughts, actions, and results)
- Retrieves recent and related episodes

## MetaCognitiveKnowledgeSystem

The `MetaCognitiveKnowledgeSystem` handles meta-cognitive processes, including self-monitoring and performance analysis.

Key features:
- Logs and retrieves performance data
- Enhances performance through analysis and feedback
- Generalizes knowledge across different scenarios
- Extracts key concepts from tasks

## ProceduralKnowledgeSystem

The `ProceduralKnowledgeSystem` manages knowledge related to tool usage and procedures.

Key features:
- Logs and retrieves tool usage data
- Enhances tool usage through analysis and insights

## ConceptualKnowledgeSystem

The `ConceptualKnowledgeSystem` manages conceptual knowledge and relationships between concepts.

Key features:
- Stores and retrieves related concepts
- Enhances concept understanding through analysis

## ContextualKnowledgeSystem

The `ContextualKnowledgeSystem` provides an understanding of the context in which knowledge should be applied.

Key features:
- Logs and retrieves context data for tasks
- Enhances context understanding through analysis

## SemanticKnowledgeSystem

The `SemanticKnowledgeSystem` handles semantic understanding of language.

Key features:
- Logs and retrieves meanings of phrases
- Enhances language understanding through analysis

## CausalKnowledgeSystem

The `CausalKnowledgeSystem` manages knowledge about cause-and-effect relationships.

Key features:
- Logs causal relationships between actions and outcomes
- Retrieves causes for specific outcomes and vice versa
- Generates causal chains for given actions
- Calculates success rates for actions

## CounterfactualKnowledgeSystem

The `CounterfactualKnowledgeSystem` handles hypothetical scenarios and alternative outcomes.

Key features:
- Logs simulated actions and their predicted outcomes
- Retrieves relevant simulations for specific tasks
- Predicts outcomes for new actions based on past simulations
- Simulates task decomposition and preemptive debugging

## Integration

All these knowledge systems work together to provide a comprehensive knowledge management solution:

1. The `KnowledgeGraph` serves as the central storage system.
2. The `EmbeddingManager` provides semantic understanding capabilities.
3. Specialized systems (Episodic, MetaCognitive, Procedural, Conceptual, Contextual, Semantic, Causal, and Counterfactual) handle different aspects of knowledge.
4. Each system interacts with the `KnowledgeGraph` to store and retrieve information.
5. The `ChatGPT` class is used across systems to generate insights and enhance understanding.

This integrated approach allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and utilization of various types of knowledge, enabling the AGI to learn, reason, and make informed decisions across a wide range of tasks and contexts.

## AgentKnowledgeInterface

The `AgentKnowledgeInterface` class serves as a unified interface for the agent to interact with all knowledge systems.

Key features:
- Initializes and manages all knowledge systems
- Provides methods for gathering relevant knowledge for tasks
- Updates knowledge based on task results and agent actions
- Facilitates decision-making by integrating information from various knowledge systems

By using the AgentKnowledgeInterface, the agent can efficiently access and update its knowledge across all specialized systems, enabling more informed and context-aware decision-making.
