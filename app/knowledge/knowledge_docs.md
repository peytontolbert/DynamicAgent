# Knowledge Systems Documentation

This document provides an overview of the various knowledge systems implemented in our AGI architecture.

## EmbeddingManager

The `EmbeddingManager` class is responsible for managing text embeddings, including encoding, caching, similarity search, and dimensionality reduction.

Key features:
- Encodes text into embeddings using a pre-trained model
- Caches embeddings for efficient retrieval
- Performs similarity search using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance
- Supports FAISS index for fast similarity search
- Provides dimensionality reduction using PCA or t-SNE

## KnowledgeGraph

The `KnowledgeGraph` class represents the central knowledge storage system, using a Neo4j graph database.

Key features:
- Stores nodes and relationships in a graph structure
- Supports adding, updating, and retrieving nodes and relationships
- Integrates with the EmbeddingManager for semantic search

## EpisodicKnowledgeSystem

The `EpisodicKnowledgeSystem` manages episodic memory, storing and retrieving task-related experiences.

Key features:
- Logs tasks and their results
- Analyzes tasks and provides insights
- Memorizes episodes (thoughts, actions, and results)
- Retrieves recent and related episodes

## MetaCognitiveKnowledgeSystem

The `MetaCognitiveKnowledgeSystem` handles meta-cognitive processes, including self-monitoring and performance analysis.

Key features:
- Logs and retrieves performance data
- Enhances performance through analysis and feedback
- Generalizes knowledge across different scenarios
- Extracts key concepts from tasks

## ProceduralKnowledgeSystem

The `ProceduralKnowledgeSystem` manages knowledge related to tool usage and procedures.

Key features:
- Logs and retrieves tool usage data
- Enhances tool usage through analysis and insights

## ConceptualKnowledgeSystem

The `ConceptualKnowledgeSystem` manages conceptual knowledge and relationships between concepts.

Key features:
- Stores and retrieves related concepts
- Enhances concept understanding through analysis

## ContextualKnowledgeSystem

The `ContextualKnowledgeSystem` provides an understanding of the context in which knowledge should be applied.

Key features:
- Logs and retrieves context data for tasks
- Enhances context understanding through analysis

## SemanticKnowledgeSystem

The `SemanticKnowledgeSystem` handles semantic understanding of language.

Key features:
- Logs and retrieves meanings of phrases
- Enhances language understanding through analysis

## CausalKnowledgeSystem

The `CausalKnowledgeSystem` manages knowledge about cause-and-effect relationships.

Key features:
- Logs causal relationships between actions and outcomes
- Retrieves causes for specific outcomes and vice versa
- Generates causal chains for given actions
- Calculates success rates for actions

## CounterfactualKnowledgeSystem

The `CounterfactualKnowledgeSystem` handles hypothetical scenarios and alternative outcomes.

Key features:
- Logs simulated actions and their predicted outcomes
- Retrieves relevant simulations for specific tasks
- Predicts outcomes for new actions based on past simulations
- Simulates task decomposition and preemptive debugging

## SpatialKnowledgeSystem

The `SpatialKnowledgeSystem` manages knowledge related to spatial reasoning and relationships.

Key features:
- Stores and retrieves spatial data
- Provides methods for spatial reasoning and analysis
- Integrates with the `KnowledgeGraph` for spatial data storage

## TemporalKnowledgeSystem

The `TemporalKnowledgeSystem` manages knowledge related to time-based reasoning and temporal relationships.

Key features:
- Stores and retrieves temporal data
- Provides methods for temporal reasoning and analysis
- Integrates with the `KnowledgeGraph` for temporal data storage

## Integration

All these knowledge systems work together to provide a comprehensive knowledge management solution:

1. The `KnowledgeGraph` serves as the central storage system.
2. The `EmbeddingManager` provides semantic understanding capabilities.
3. Specialized systems (Episodic, MetaCognitive, Procedural, Conceptual, Contextual, Semantic, Causal, Counterfactual, Spatial, Temporal) handle different aspects of knowledge.
4. The `CommunityManager` builds a graph from the knowledge data, detects communities, generates summaries, and handles queries by generating partial answers from relevant communities.
5. Each system interacts with the `KnowledgeGraph` to store and retrieve information.
6. For complex queries, systems can leverage the `CommunityManager` to get summarized and contextually relevant information from specific communities.
7. The `ChatGPT` class is used across systems to generate insights and enhance understanding.
