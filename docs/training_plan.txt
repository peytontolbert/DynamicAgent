Enhanced LLM Agent Training Plan
1. Initial Knowledge Base Population

Populate the graph database with foundational knowledge across all layers (Systematic, Episodic, Periodic, Conceptual, Contextual, and Meta-cognitive).
Ensure the RAG system is properly integrated and indexed.
Include specific knowledge about the agent's decision-action-loop process and task completion criteria.

2. Decision-Action Loop Training

Design tasks that require multiple iterations of the decide-action loop.
Train the agent to effectively choose between respond and code_execute actions in each iteration.
Implement a scoring system to evaluate the efficiency of the agent's decisions and actions.

3. Task Completion Verification Training

Utilize the agent's ability to use the respond action to verify task completion accurately.
Train the agent to provide clear, concise completion reports for user verification.
Simulate user responses to help the agent learn from both correct and incorrect completion assessments.

4. Complex Task Decomposition

Present the agent with complex tasks that require breaking down into subtasks.
Train the agent to manage its decision-action loop for each subtask while maintaining overall task progress.
Develop the agent's ability to switch between subtasks efficiently when blocked or waiting for user input.

5. Error Handling and Recovery within the Loop

Introduce intentional errors or ambiguities in tasks.
Train the agent to recognize errors, decide on appropriate recovery actions, and execute them within its loop.
Develop the agent's ability to request clarification using the respond action when needed, without breaking its loop.

6. Contextual Decision Making

Design scenarios where the optimal action changes based on previous actions or task context.
Train the agent to maintain and utilize contextual information throughout its decision-action loop.
Develop the agent's ability to explain its decision-making process using the respond action when appropriate.

7. Efficiency Optimization

Implement metrics to measure the number of loop iterations, time taken, and resources used for task completion.
Train the agent to optimize its decisions and actions to minimize unnecessary iterations and resource usage.
Develop the agent's ability to predict task completion time and provide progress updates.

8. Multi-Modal Task Handling

Create tasks that require switching between different programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Bash) within a single task.
Train the agent to seamlessly transition between language contexts in its code_execute actions.
Develop the agent's ability to explain code logic across different languages using the respond action.

9. User Interaction Optimization

Simulate various user interaction scenarios, including unclear instructions, mid-task changes, and different levels of technical expertise.
Train the agent to adapt its respond actions to the user's level of understanding and preferences.
Develop the agent's ability to maintain task progress while handling user interruptions or additional requests.

10. Continuous Learning Integration

Implement mechanisms for the agent to update its knowledge base based on task outcomes and user feedback.
Train the agent to recognize novel patterns or information during task execution and incorporate them into future decision-making.
Develop the agent's ability to suggest improvements to its own decision-action loop process.

11. Performance Analysis and Refinement

Regularly analyze the agent's performance across various task types and complexities.
Identify patterns in decision-making, action execution, and loop efficiency.
Refine the agent's decision-making algorithms and knowledge utilization based on performance data.

12. Real-World Scenario Testing

Simulate real-world, open-ended tasks with ambiguous completion criteria.
Evaluate the agent's ability to navigate complex scenarios while maintaining its decision-action loop integrity.
Test the agent's capacity to handle multiple related tasks concurrently, managing separate decision-action loops for each.
